                  Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) are areas within cities that become significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. This temperature difference—often 15°F to 20°F higher—is caused by the way cities are built and the amount of human activity they contain. 
                  <br><br>
                  In densely developed urban areas, buildings, roads, and infrastructure absorb and retain heat. Unlike rural areas, cities lack trees and green spaces that provide shade and cooling. Combined with vehicle emissions and energy use, these factors create hot zones that can be uncomfortable and dangerous during heatwaves.

                <p>
                  This interactive site explores <strong>urban heat islands (UHIs)</strong> in three U.S. cities: <strong>Atlanta, GA</strong>, <strong>Washington, D.C.</strong>, and <strong>Boston, MA</strong>. Using <strong>Landsat imagery</strong> from two time periods for each city, we compare <strong>land surface temperature</strong> (LST) to reveal how heat distribution has changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Satellite images were downloaded from <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS EarthExplorer</a>. This data helps us visualize UHI growth linked to urban expansion, infrastructure, and climate.

                  Click a city in the menu to explore its <strong>interactive LST map</strong>. You can use the <strong>layer toggle</strong> tool to compare older and newer maps. Scroll down on each city’s page for an explanation of the temperature map and a reference image of the city.

                    <h5> An Urban Heat Island, or UHI, is a metropolitan area that's a lot warmer than the rural areas surrounding it. </h5>
                    <img src="https://www.littlerock.gov/media/19050/uhi-effect.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Urban Heat Island Effect Diagram">
                    <p> Urban Heat Islands (UHIs) are areas within cities that become significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. This temperature difference—often 15°F to 20°F higher—is caused by the way cities are built and the amount of human activity they contain. In densely developed urban areas like New York, Paris, or London, buildings, roads, and other infrastructure absorb and retain heat from the sun. Materials like concrete and asphalt trap this heat during the day and release it slowly at night, keeping the environment warm around the clock.
                        <br> 
                        Unlike rural areas, cities often lack trees and green spaces that provide shade and cooling through evaporation. Instead, the "concrete jungle" of buildings and paved surfaces stores heat, while energy from cars, buses, trains, and people adds even more warmth. When buildings and homes are packed closely together, they also help insulate the area, preventing heat from escaping. All these factors combine to create UHIs—hot zones that can make city living more uncomfortable and even dangerous during heatwaves.</p>

                    <p>
                      This interactive site explores the phenomenon of <strong>urban heat islands (UHIs)</strong> in three major U.S. cities: <strong>Atlanta, GA</strong>, <strong>Washington, D.C.</strong>, and <strong>Boston, MA</strong>. UHIs occur when urban areas experience significantly warmer surface temperatures than surrounding rural regions due to human activities, dense infrastructure, and reduced vegetation. To visualize and better understand these temperature differences over time, I used satellite data to create side-by-side comparisons of <strong>land surface temperature (LST)</strong> for each city.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      The satellite imagery was sourced from the <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS EarthExplorer</a>, a publicly available tool provided by the U.S. Geological Survey. I selected imagery from two different time periods for each city—ranging from <strong>2015–2016</strong> to more recent years like <strong>2023–2024</strong>—using <strong>Landsat satellite data</strong>. These datasets allowed me to create thermal visualizations that reveal how heat distribution has shifted, possibly due to urban development, climate change, or environmental initiatives.

                    <p>
                      To explore each city, simply click on its name in the navigation bar above. Each city page features an <strong>interactive map</strong> with two thermal images that can be compared using a <strong>toggle tool</strong>. This tool lets you switch between the older and more recent LST layers to identify changes in heat patterns. Below each map, you'll find a detailed explanation of the imagery and a color-coded legend indicating temperature ranges (in Kelvin). At the bottom of each page, there’s also a representative image of the city to provide context.

                      This project aims to highlight the importance of urban design, vegetation, and sustainable planning in mitigating heat-related impacts on cities. Whether you're a student, researcher, or city planner, this site offers a visual tool for understanding how urban environments evolve over time—and how that evolution affects the climate we live in.

         <p> Extreme heat intensifies in developed areas with many buildings and roads, but few trees or green spaces. In these areas, heat gets stored by unshaded concrete and asphalt, which then radiate heat back into the air and cause the temperatures to be 15°F to 20°F warmer in "urban heat islands."</p>
